# Back-to-the-Basics-FlashCards
An entry-level back-to-the-basics style flash card application for going over the basics of OOP and C# wtih some SQL/HTML/CSS/JS scattered in as well.


Written as a way to get a little additional basic practice with Vue.js, I thought it would be fun to make a simple flash card program to show my teammates so everyone can keep the basics in mind as we move rapidly through so many different technologies and terms.
